# qlab-scripts

Complex [QLab](https://qlab.app/) programming can be made much simpler with the use of Applescript automation. This is a collection of scripts I have found useful in various situations. Some are broadly useful, some are very specific to one particular problem. Some I wrote for myself, some I wrote to make someone else's workflow easier.

The best way to browse the available scripts is to use the documentation site, available here: https://samschloegel.github.io/qlab-scripts/

Any questions, suggestions, bug reports, or other feedback - please [submit an issue](https://github.com/samschloegel/qlab-scripts/issues) or [send me an email](mailto:hello@schloegel.nyc)!

Let me know if you get any use out of these, I'd love to hear about it.

Cheers,

Sam
