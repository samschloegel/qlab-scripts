# Create Groups

## Group Selected Individually

Encapsulate each selected cue within its own group.

## Group Selected, Inherit Name

Puts selected cues in a group together.

Why use this instead of the New Group Cue hotkey? Because it works even if there is only one cue selected - and in that case, it will copy the cue's name to the group's name.
