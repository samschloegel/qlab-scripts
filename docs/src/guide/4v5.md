# QLab 4 vs QLab 5:

The scripts that appear in this guide are written for QLab 5. Versions which are compatible with QLab 4 can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/samschloegel/qlab-scripts/tree/main/scripts%20v4).

::: warning COMPATIBILITY AND UPDATES
Over time, I will be spending less time consciously updating scripts for QLab 4. Most of the v4 scripts were last used/tested before the release of QLab 4.7.0.
