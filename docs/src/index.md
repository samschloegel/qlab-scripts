This is a collection of scripts I have found useful in various situations. Some are broadly useful, some are very specific to one particular problem. Some I wrote for myself, some I wrote to make someone else's workflow easier.

If you're interested in learning to use AppleScript with QLab, or just want to borrow from here, feel free to explore.
